# Scrum Structure

### Create the initial planning of your project by using Scrum.

#### Make sure to include:

  1. Product backlog (requirements or user stories)
  2. Sprint backlogs
  3. Duration of Sprints
  4. Scrum artifacts (burndown chart, scrumboard, etc.)

## 1. Product Backlog
  - As a user, I want to:
    * Create a user account
    * View user accoount
    * Update user account
    * Delete user account  
    &nbsp;
    * Login to the website
    * Logout of the website
    * Change my password
    * Reset a password
    * Reset username  
    &nbsp;
    * Use the munter calculator to determine tour times
    * Create a new tour
    * Read all my tours
    * Update tours
    * Delete tours

## 2. Sprint Backlog
  - Sprint 1
    * Initial Project Setup
    * Basic webpages setup

  - Sprint 2
    * Munter Calculation

  - Sprint 3
    * Databse and Models

  - Sprint 4
    * CRUD Operations

  - Sprint 5
  - Sprint 6


## 3. Duration of Sprints
  As the project is fairly simple, there is a limited amount of time, and only one person working on the project, sprints will be kept short. I believe this will help by setting small and attainable goals, and also to get the feel for multiple sprints. I was thinking 2-4 day working sprints.

## 4. Scrum Artifacts
  None at the moment.

### 2. Duration of Sprints
As the project is fairly simple, there is a limited amount of time, and only one person working on the project, sprints will be kept short. I believe this will help by setting small and attainable goals, and also to get the feel for multiple sprints. I was thinking 2-4 day working sprints.
